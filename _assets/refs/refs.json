  {"id":"almogThermalStabilityThin2021","abstract":"Thin metal films deposited on patterned or rough substrates play an increasing role in microelectronics, sensing, catalysis, and other areas of nanotechnology. However, the thermal stability and solid state dewetting of thin metal films with complex three-dimensional architecture is still poorly understood. In this work we employed a model system of nanocrystalline Au thin films deposited on prismatic single crystalline KCl whiskers to study the solid state dewetting of thin films in a three-dimensional setting. The arrays of KCl whiskers were grown on porous substrates under well-defined humidity and temperature conditions. Single crystalline prismatic KCl whiskers with a very high aspect ratio, [001] axis and {100} side facets were obtained. The whiskers were coated with thin conformal Au films of 20-30 nm in thickness. The annealing of these core-shell whiskers at the temperature of 350oC resulted in solid state dewetting of the Au film, with the dewetting processes occurring much faster along the whisker edges than on the side facets. The orientation relationships between Au and KCl were determined by employing similarly prepared thin Au films deposited on the flat KCl (100) substrates. Inspired by our experimental results, we developed a numerical model describing the curvature-gradient driven and surface diffusion-controlled growth of a hole in the thin film deposited on a curved substrate. The model predicted the growth of anisotropic elliptical holes elongated along the whisker axis. We discuss the experimental results in terms of the proposed model, indicating the importance of the change in orientation relationship between the Au grains and KCl whisker along the whisker edges.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,2,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Almog","given":"Ehud"},{"family":"Derkach","given":"Vadim"},{"family":"Sharma","given":"Amit"},{"family":"Novick-Cohen","given":"Amy"},{"family":"Greer","given":"Julia R."},{"family":"Rabkin","given":"Eugen"}],"citation-key":"almogThermalStabilityThin2021","container-title":"Acta Materialia","container-title-short":"Acta Materialia","DOI":"10/gsdf45","ISSN":"1359-6454","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,2,15]]},"language":"en","page":"116537","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Thermal stability of thin Au films deposited on salt whiskers","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1359645420309745","volume":"205"},

The T-NSTAP is a sub-miniature, free-standing, platinum wire suspended between silicon supports, designed for temperature measurements at high frequencies. The new sensor is designed to have a bandwidth far superior to that of conventional cold-wires, which in combination with its small size, minimizes the effect of temporal and spatial filtering on the data. Unfiltered data allows for unique investigations of the scalar turbulence, including the dissipation range. Temperature measurements were conducted with the T-NSTAP in a heated grid-turbulence setup, with constant mean temperature gradient, and compared to data acquired with a conventional cold-wire. It is shown that the cold-wire signal is significantly attenuated over a broad range of frequencies, including lower frequencies. The attenuation has a direct and substantial effect on the measured variances and the estimated scalar rate of dissipation. The observed differences between the conventional cold-wire and the T-NSTAP are compared to what is predicted by a cold-wire model with convincing agreement over the entire spectrum. A close to perfect agreement between the two sensors is shown when the cold-wire data is corrected for end-conduction effects using the cold-wire model.

The paper elaborates on the fabrication steps of the thermal flow sensor. Three resistive heater size configurations of dimensions 100 μm × 100 μm, 300 μm × 300 μm, and 1000 μm × 1000 μm were fabricated. The thermoresistive properties of 3C-SiC on glass were investigated from ambient temperature to 443 K. The characterization of the SiC heater and temperature sensors revealed a high thermoresistive effect with a temperature coefficient of resistance (TCR) of approximately −20,716 ppm/K at ambient temperature(298 K) and −9367 ppm/K at 443 K respectively. The performance of the sensors was evaluated based on the sensitivity of the flow sensor. For a turbulent flow velocity of 7.4 m/s, the sensitivity of the sensor operating in the constant -voltage mode is 0.091 s/m with a power consumption of 133.50 mW for the 1000 μm × 1000 μm heater. Finally, a study on the flow direction was conducted to confirm the operation of 2-D direction independent hot-film flow sensor. Results indicated that the performance of the sensor remained the same when the flow direction was perpendicular to SiC heater and sensor respectively. However, the best sensitivity was achieved by passing air flow perpendicular to the sensing elements. The high TCR of the single crystalline 3C-SiC material, the relatively low power consumption on the order of milliwatts and the high sensitivity of our sensor demonstrates its potential use for high temperature flow sensing applications.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,4,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Balakrishnan","given":"Vivekananthan"},{"family":"Dinh","given":"Toan"},{"family":"Phan","given":"Hoang-Phuong"},{"family":"Dao","given":"Dzung Viet"},{"family":"Nguyen","given":"Nam-Trung"}],"citation-key":"balakrishnanHighlySensitive3CSiC2018","container-title":"Sensors and Actuators A: Physical","container-title-short":"Sensors and Actuators A: Physical","DOI":"10/gfbgrf","ISSN":"0924-4247","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,8,15]]},"language":"en","page":"293-305","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Highly sensitive 3C-SiC on glass based thermal flow sensor realized using MEMS technology","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0924424718301638","volume":"279"},

  {"id":"baradelMicroanemometriePourAerodynamique2023","abstract":"La turbulence est un phénomène important présent dans de nombreux écoulements, qu'ils soient naturels ou à application industrielle, et qui se caractérise notamment par une grande variété d'échelles spatiales et temporelles. Il est donc d'un intérêt particulier de développer des moyens métrologiques adaptés à la mesure des différentes grandeurs physiques permettant de mieux appréhender et caractériser celle-ci.\nDans le cadre de mesures aérodynamiques, les capteurs les plus communément employés encore aujourd'hui sont ainsi l'anémomètre à fil chaud pour des mesures de vitesses et le thermomètre à fil froid pour les mesures de température. Cependant ces deux moyens de mesures présentent des limitations. En effet, il a été montré que si la longueur de leur élément sensible était trop grande en comparaison des échelles caractéristiques de l'écoulement alors ces sondes opèrent un filtrage spatial des plus petites échelles de turbulence, pourtant nécessaires à la résolution complète de ce type d'écoulement. Devant ce constat, ces travaux de thèse se posent pour question la possibilité d'une amélioration de ces deux moyens métrologiques. De par les limitations qu'ils rencontrent, l'axe d'amélioration principal considéré réside dans la réduction de la taille de leur élément sensible permettant ainsi d'augmenter la gamme d'échelles spatiales mesurables dans un écoulement turbulent. De plus, dans le cadre de la caractérisation d'écoulements aérothermiques, il apparait comme d'intérêt de pouvoir effectuer des mesures simultanées de vitesse et de température. Il est donc envisagé d'utiliser les technologies de mesure par fil chaud et fil froid pour réaliser ceci.\nCette étude consiste donc au développement de micro-capteurs thermorésistifs permettant de repousser la limite de détection des petites échelles contenues dans un écoulement turbulent. Le premier objectif est de réaliser des sondes fonctionnelles permettant de réaliser des mesures anémométriques ou thermométriques pour ensuite se tourner vers un second objectif visant à développer un capteur du même type mais effectuant ces deux mesures de façon simultanée.\nPour atteindre ces objectifs, il a été premièrement question d'effectuer un choix pertinent sur les matériaux utilisés ainsi que d'étudier différents procédés de micro-fabrication, notamment de gravure du silicium. Ceci a alors permis de réaliser différentes géométries de micro-capteur afin d'identifier celle étant la plus appropriée aux mesures en écoulement turbulents. Afin de quantifier leur capacité à mesurer des fluctuations de vitesses, ces nouveaux capteurs ont été utilisés pour des mesures en couche limite turbulente, une attention particulière ayant été portée sur la maitrise du protocole expérimental. Les résultats obtenus ont été comparés à différents modèles semi-empiriques ainsi qu'à des mesures effectuées avec des sondes à fil chaud classiques. Dans l'objectif d'observer la performance des micro-capteurs pour des mesures de température, un banc expérimental spécifique a été conçu donnant ainsi accès aux réponses fréquentielles pour ce type de mesure.

The high-purity alumina provides an inert plasma environment, and allows for temperatures above 1000°C, which is beneficial for future integration of a combustor. To facilitate the design of high-end plasma sources, characterization of the radio frequency (RF) parameters of the materials around 2.6 GHz is carried out. A RF resonator structure was fabricated in both microstrip and stripline configurations. These resonators were geometrically and electrically characterized, and εr and tan $${\\delta}$$were calculated using the RF waveguide design tool Wcalc. The resulting εr for the microstrip and stripline was found to be 10.68 (±0.12) and 9.65 (±0.14), respectively. The average tan $${\\delta}$$of all devices was found to be 0.0011 (±0.0007).

This paper is focused on the design, fabrication and test of a micro electromechanical system (MEMS) pressure sensor array for high-resolution wall pressure measurements in turbulent flows. In contrast to pressure sensor arrays in literature this array is highly sensitive and can be flush mounted on top of a cylinder without using pin holes and flexible tubes. Employing silicon-on-insulator (SOI) technology and deep silicon etching the sensors developed achieve a pressure resolution of 0.5Pa. Three different types of sensors, featuring a diaphragm thickness of 3μm and diaphragm sizes of 500μm, 700μm, and 900μm (square diaphragm), have been fabricated and characterized. Simulation of the dynamic behavior yields resonance frequencies of 50kHz (900μm-diaphragm), 82kHz (700μm-diaphragm), and 160kHz (500μm-diaphragm). Sensitivities of 12μV/(VPa) (900μm-sensor), 7μV/(VPa) (700μm-sensor), and 3μV/(VPa) (500μm-sensor) are obtained in measurement ranges of ±200Pa, ±500Pa, and ±1kPa, respectively, featuring a non-linearity of less than 1%.

  {"id":"bongrainNewTechnologiesDiamond2011","abstract":"Les propriétés physiques et chimiques exceptionnelles du matériau diamant ont suscité l'intérêt des chercheurs pour le développement d'applications industrielles, comme par exemple dans les domaines de la dissipation thermique ou de l'électronique de puissance. En particulier, les propriétés mécaniques remarquables de ce matériau peuvent être exploitées avantageusement pour la conception de résonateurs MEMS (Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems). Même si certains dispositifs MEMS à base de diamant avaient été décrits dans la littérature, les propriétés mécaniques de ce matériau n'avaient jamais été associées à ses propriétés chimiques pour la réalisation de transducteurs chimiques ou biochimiques à base de résonateurs MEMS. Ainsi, l'objectif cette thèse a été de démontrer l'intérêt de ce matériau innovant pour la fabrication de ces capteurs. Les MEMS offrent la possibilité de faire de la détection en temps réel de manière directe (sans marqueur), rapide et sensible, sur de faibles quantités d'analytes. De plus ils permettent d'adresser des cibles non électro-actives qui ne peuvent pas être détectées par des capteurs électrochimiques. Dans cette étude, nous avons développé dans un premier temps des procédés de micro-structuration spécifiques du diamant. Ces procédés entièrement compatibles avec des techniques de salle blanche ont permis d'aboutir à la réalisation de nombreux transducteurs à base de micro-leviers en diamant sur des substrats en silicium de 4 pouces. De plus les approches développées permettent d'éviter la gravure fastidieuse du matériau diamant. Leur caractérisation mécanique en régime dynamique a permis de caractériser le module d'Young E du matériau diamant synthétisé en fonction des conditions de croissance. Dans le meilleur cas une valeur de E très élevée de l'ordre de 1100 GPa a été obtenue, ce qui est très proche de la valeur du diamant monocristallin (1200GPa). Par ailleurs, nous avons pu vérifier que les propriétés de résonance (fréquence de résonance et facteur de qualité) des structures en diamant réalisées étaient supérieures à celles de structures identiques en silicium. En particulier, cela rend ces résonateurs plus aptes à être exploités en milieux liquides. Nous avons montré que dans de tels milieux les micro-leviers en diamant étaient très peu sensibles à une variation massique. En revanche leur sensibilité à une variation de masse volumique du liquide est de l'ordre de 3Hz.kg-1.m3 et donc significative. Par ailleurs, en fonctionnalisant des micro-leviers en diamant par de l'acide caproïque, nous avons mis en évidence que des variations de densité de charges à la surface des micro-leviers pouvaient induire des variations de fréquence de résonance de plusieurs dizaines de Hz dans le cas de structures vibrant à quelques kHz. Ceci a permis de mettre en évidence la grande sensibilité de nos transducteurs en diamant à des interactions moléculaires. Dans ce contexte nous avons pu réaliser un capteur d'ADN permettant la reconnaissance spécifique en temps réel de brins d'ADN cibles de 24 paires de bases sans marqueur. En parallèle de ces travaux, des structures d'actionnement et de lecture ont été intégrées et évalué sur des dispositifs résonants à base de diamant.

  {"id":"bruunHotWireAnemometryPrinciples1996","abstract":"Hot-wire anemometry (HWA) is one of the basic measuring techniques used by research scientists and engineers working in fluid mechanics. It is applicable to a wide variety of flows from studies of atmospheric phenomena to investigations of supersonic flows. HWA is an indirect measuring technique based on the heat transfer from a sensing element and for this reason is very sensitive to ambient variations in the temperature. The use of HWA is therefore not usually recommended for the measurement of mean flow properties. However, owing to the fast response and good spatial resolution of the technique, it is irreplaceable for investigations of rapidly varying flows and especially turbulence. Different modes of operation of the hot-wires permit measurements of velocity, temperature and concentration at a modest price and effort which makes the technique attractive and profitable in many situations. In spite of tremendous developments of other measuring techniques over the past two decades, particularly optical techniques such as laser-Doppler anemometry (LDA) or particle image velocimetry (PIV), HWA retains a number of distinct advantages which ensure its present and future use. Hans Bruun has written a comprehensive book which provides a state-of-the-art survey on developments and use of HWA. In many details the book complements the classical monographs of Corrsin (1963), Melnik and Weske (1967) and the more recent contributions to the subject from Perry (1982) and Lomas (1986). The author approaches the subject in an easy to read, straightforward manner, starting with the basic principles of HWA. He avoids putting much effort into describing the electronic arrangements or compensation networks, concentrating on the heat transfer considerations and the time/space resolution capabilities of HWA for turbulence measurements. The author proceeds with a general introduction to the velocity measurements. The material is informative and introduces topics such as the response equations used for HWA signal interpretation and methods for data acquisition, processing and presentation. Separate chapters are devoted to one-, two- and three-component velocity measurements. The author continues at considerable length with all necessary information about HWA for conducting measurements, including probe design and manufacture, aerodynamic effects of prongs and probe support, calibration techniques and signal interpretation. The emphasis is placed on methods which have been successfully used in turbulence research in the past. Temperature effects and measurements of the temperature fluctuations are presented in chapter 7. A good account is given of the methods for correcting hot-wire readings for drift in the ambient fluid temperature. The text also covers the resistance-wire method for measurements of the instantaneous temperature fluctuations. The author dedicates a separate chapter to hot-wire techniques used for investigating reverse flows and near-wall flows. The pulsed and flying hot-wire techniques as well as the split film probes are discussed in detail. A brief account is also given of other interesting attempts to extend the applicability of HWA to flows of high turbulence intensity. This chapter ends with an extensive analysis of near-wall hot-wire measurements and the determination of the wall shear stress. The author summarizes in a separate chapter successful extensions of the HWA technique beyond conventional applications. The material covered includes the determination of the void-fraction and turbulence properties in two-phase flows, evaluation of concentration fluctuations in gas mixtures and turbulence measurements in compressible flows. Vorticity measurements are discussed in chapter 10. These are of special importance to turbulence modelling since the vorticity is directly related to the turbulent dissipation rate. Modelling of the transport equation for this quantity seems to be the weakest link in the existing turbulence models used for engineering applications (CFD). This is good discussion of instantaneous velocity gradient measurements in turbulent flows and a good description of basic and more recent complex hot-wire configurations used for the vorticity measurements. The last two chapters deal with conditional sampling and time series analysis of turbulence fluctuations. There is plenty of interesting material related to processing and averaging signals measured in periodic flows, intermittency measurements and identification of coherent structures in turbulent flows. The closing chapter provides a useful survey of conventional statistical analysis of random signals in amplitude and phase domains. The list of the references at the end provides a complete overview of virtually all important studies related to HWA published to date. This is an excellent book written in a clear and readable style suitable for students, research scientists and engineers. The text is well supported by mathematical analysis and, whenever necessary, with adequate illustrations and diagrams. I highly recommend the book to everyone working in the field of experimental fluid mechanics. It should be obligatory reading for students involved in turbulence measurements.

The readout circuit periodically heats up the transducer and uses a phase-domain ΔΣ modulator to digitize the phase shift of the resulting temperature transients. A single resistive transducer is used both as a heater and as a temperature sensor, thus greatly simplifying its fabrication. To extract the transducer's resistance, and hence its temperature, in the presence of large heating currents, a pair of transducers is configured as a differentially driven bridge. The transducers and the readout circuit have been implemented in a standard 0.16-μm CMOS technology, with an active area of 0.3 and 3.14 mm2, respectively. The sensor consumes 6.8 mW from a 1.8-V supply, of which 6.3 mW is dissipated in the transducers.

  {"id":"caiSurfaceStructureComposition2005","abstract":"To correlate flat titanium film surface properties with deposition parameters, titanium flat thin films were systematically deposited on glass substrates with various thicknesses and evaporation rates by electron-beam evaporation. The chemical compositions, crystal structure, surface topographies as well as wettability were investigated by using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), atomic force microscopy (AFM) and water contact angle measurement, respectively. The films consisted mainly of TiO2. Small percentages of Ti2O3 and metallic Ti were also found at the film surface using high-resolution XPS analysis. Quantitative XPS showed little differences regarding elemental compositions among different groups of films. The films were obtained by varying the deposition rate and the film thickness, respectively. XRD data showed consistent reflection patterns of the different titanium samples deposited using different film thicknesses. Without exception measurements of all samples exhibited contact angles of 80°±5°. Quantitative AFM characterization demonstrated good correlation tendency between surface roughness and film thickness or evaporation rate, respectively. It is important to notice that titanium films with different sizes of grains on their surfaces but having the same chemistry and film bulk structure can be obtained in a controllable way. By increasing the film thickness and evaporation rate, the surface roughness increased. The surface morphology and grain size growth displayed a corresponding trend. Therefore, the control of these parameters allows us to prepare titanium films with desired surface properties in a controllable and reproducible way for further biological investigations of these materials.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,4,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Cai","given":"Kaiyong"},{"family":"Müller","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Bossert","given":"Jörg"},{"family":"Rechtenbach","given":"Annett"},{"family":"Jandt","given":"Klaus D."}],"citation-key":"caiSurfaceStructureComposition2005","container-title":"Applied Surface Science","container-title-short":"Applied Surface Science","DOI":"10/fqs4jd","ISSN":"0169-4332","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2005,8,31]]},"language":"en","page":"252-267","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Surface structure and composition of flat titanium thin films as a function of film thickness and evaporation rate","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169433205000395","volume":"250"},
  {"id":"calafCoherentStructuresSpectral2013","abstract":"Here we present unique evidence of a k−1 scaling behaviour in the atmospheric boundary layer and its connection to large scale coherent structures within the boundary layer. Wind lidar measurements were conducted above a lake under cold atmospheric conditions. The large coherent structures could be visually observed over Lake Geneva in Switzerland when cold air met the relatively warm water. Proper orthogonal decomposition of the experimental data acquired with the wind lidar clearly reveals coherent oscillations of both the fluctuating velocity field and the water aerosol field over the surface of the lake. Precise identification of the large coherent structures propagating in the flow allows for detailed analysis of their contribution to the total spectral budget. Additionally, it is shown that the experimental data agree well with recent theoretical predictions.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,6,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Calaf","given":"M."},{"family":"Hultmark","given":"M."},{"family":"Oldroyd","given":"H.

At a bias voltage of 10 V, the sensor exhibits a linear dynamic sensitivity of 7.66 mV/Pa up to the testing limit of 1.9 Pa, a flat frequency response with resonance at 6.2 kHz, and a pressure rejection of 64 dB.

  {"id":"chengHighThermalConductivity2022","abstract":"High thermal conductivity electronic materials are critical components for high-performance electronic and photonic devices as both active functional materials and thermal management materials. We report an isotropic high thermal conductivity exceeding 500 W m−1K−1 at room temperature in high-quality wafer-scale cubic silicon carbide (3C-SiC) crystals, which is the second highest among large crystals (only surpassed by diamond). Furthermore, the corresponding 3C-SiC thin films are found to have record-high in-plane and cross-plane thermal conductivity, even higher than diamond thin films with equivalent thicknesses. Our results resolve a long-standing puzzle that the literature values of thermal conductivity for 3C-SiC are lower than the structurally more complex 6H-SiC. We show that the observed high thermal conductivity in this work arises from the high purity and high crystal quality of 3C-SiC crystals which avoids the exceptionally strong defect-phonon scatterings. Moreover, 3C-SiC is a SiC polytype which can be epitaxially grown on Si. We show that the measured 3C-SiC-Si thermal boundary conductance is among the highest for semiconductor interfaces. These findings provide insights for fundamental phonon transport mechanisms, and suggest that 3C-SiC is an excellent wide-bandgap semiconductor for applications of next-generation power electronics as both active components and substrates.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,6,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Cheng","given":"Zhe"},{"family":"Liang","given":"Jianbo"},{"family":"Kawamura","given":"Keisuke"},{"family":"Zhou","given":"Hao"},{"family":"Asamura","given":"Hidetoshi"},{"family":"Uratani","given":"Hiroki"},{"family":"Tiwari","given":"Janak"},{"family":"Graham","given":"Samuel"},{"family":"Ohno","given":"Yutaka"},{"family":"Nagai","given":"Yasuyoshi"},{"family":"Feng","given":"Tianli"},{"family":"Shigekawa","given":"Naoteru"},{"family":"Cahill","given":"David G."}],"citation-key":"chengHighThermalConductivity2022","container-title":"Nature Communications","container-title-short":"Nat Commun","DOI":"10/grf6m4","ISSN":"2041-1723","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,11,23]]},"language":"en","license":"2022 The Author(s)","number":"1","page":"7201","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www.nature.com","title":"High thermal conductivity in wafer-scale cubic silicon carbide crystals","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-34943-w","volume":"13"},

The system involves a solid sample immersed in a liquid pressure medium, both of which have unknown thermal properties. The temperature (T) and P dependance of κl are first determined through the use of a modified 3ω technique. This method uses a conducting wire (Pt, in this work), which is immersed in the pressure medium, as the heater/sensor. In addition to κl , this allows for the accurate determination of the specific heat per volume of the liquid and Pt, (ρC)l and (ρC) Pt , respectively. The information of κl and (ρC)l can then be used to make corrections to measurements of κs , in which the sample is immersed in the pressure medium, and a metal strip acts as the heater/sensor.

The devices have been fabricated on thin SiN bridges with thermoelectric detectors as temperature sensors and poly-silicon resistors as heaters. A general thermal analysis of planar MEMS structures is included for calculating both the static and dynamic response of micro-TCD's. The analysis demonstrates that the performance of surface-micromachined devices can be superior to that of the more conventional bulk-micromachined devices. Methods for DC and AC readout of the device are discussed and have been implemented. The sensitivity for hydrogen in air is about 60μV per % H2 at 1mW heater dissipation.

In this paper, the influences of maskant, gas pressure and the composition of reactive gas on the etch rate and etched surface of diamond are studied. The patterned metal film used as hard mask plays an important role in etching process, it can be sputtered and re-deposited as metal oxides on the etched surface of diamond, acting as a micromask on the bottom face and a passivating layer on its sidewall. Trying to enhance the sidewall passivation and destroy the micromask on the bottom of the etched trench, the diamond film can be precisely patterned into smooth, steep and straight microstructures with inerratic and integrated boundaries and well kept dimensions of patterns as well. This is the so-called sidewall passivation mechanism for micromachining of CVD diamond. A gas mixture of oxygen and argon is used as the etching gas, with the concentration of argon being in the range of 0% to 100% (V/V), and the etching result reveals that increase in argon always leads the etch rate to going down, thus it is not necessary.

Besides the critical demands on sensing range of flow parameters (such as rate, velocity, direction and temperature), the properties of different target gases or liquids to be sensed pose challenges to the development of reliable, inexpensive and low powered sensors. This paper presents an overview of the work done on design and development of Microelectromechanical system (MEMS)-based flow sensors in recent years. In spite of using some similar principles, diverse production methods, analysis strategies, and different sensing materials, MEMS flow sensors can be broadly categorized into three main types, namely thermal sensors, piezoresistive sensors and piezoelectric sensors. Additionally, some key challenges and future prospects for the use of the MEMS flow sensors are discussed briefly.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,6,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Ejeian","given":"Fatemeh"},{"family":"Azadi","given":"Shohreh"},{"family":"Razmjou","given":"Amir"},{"family":"Orooji","given":"Yasin"},{"family":"Kottapalli","given":"Ajay"},{"family":"Ebrahimi Warkiani","given":"Majid"},{"family":"Asadnia","given":"Mohsen"}],"citation-key":"ejeianDesignApplicationsMEMS2019","container-title":"Sensors and Actuators A: Physical","container-title-short":"Sensors and Actuators A: Physical","DOI":"10/gmjgb3","ISSN":"0924-4247","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,8,15]]},"language":"en","page":"483-502","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Design and applications of MEMS flow sensors: A review","title-short":"Design and applications of MEMS flow sensors","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0924424719302559","volume":"295"},

In this paper, the fabrication methods as well as optical and electrical characteristics of silicon carbide nanocrystals, nanowires, nanotubes, and nanosized films are reviewed. Silicon carbide nanocrystals are generally produced using two techniques, electrochemical etching of bulk materials to form porous SiC or embedding SiC crystallites in a matrix such as Si. Luminescence from SiC crystallites prepared by these two methods is generally believed to stem from surface or defect states. Stable colloidal 3C-SiC nanocrystals which exhibit intense visible photoluminescence arising from the quantum confinement effects have recently be produced.

  {"id":"frenchPrecisionHarshEnvironments2016","abstract":"Microsystems are increasingly being applied in harsh and/or inaccessible environments, but many markets expect the same level of functionality for long periods of time. Harsh environments cover areas that can be subjected to high temperature, (bio)-chemical and mechanical disturbances, electromagnetic noise, radiation, or high vacuum. In the field of actuators, the devices must maintain stringent accuracy specifications for displacement, force, and response times, among others. These new requirements present additional challenges in the compensation for or elimination of cross-sensitivities. Many state-of-the-art precision devices lose their precision and reliability when exposed to harsh environments. It is also important that advanced sensor and actuator systems maintain maximum autonomy such that the devices can operate independently with low maintenance. The next-generation microsystems will be deployed in remote and/or inaccessible and harsh environments that present many challenges to sensor design, materials, device functionality, and packaging. All of these aspects of integrated sensors and actuator microsystems require a multidisciplinary approach to overcome these challenges. The main areas of importance are in the fields of materials science, micro/nano-fabrication technology, device design, circuitry and systems, (first-level) packaging, and measurement strategy.

  {"id":"fuHighTemperatureHeatFlux2020","abstract":"Heat flux sensors (HFSs) are extensively used in combustion-related applications to collect important engineering data. However, most non-water cooling HFSs lack the durability to survive in the harsh, high-temperature environments where they are employed. A new type of thin-film HFS based on a W-5Re/W-26Re thermocouple has been developed for high-temperature heat flux measurement. The sensor consists of 136 pairs of micron-sized W-5Re/W-26Re thin-film thermocouples, an SiO2 thermal-resistance layer, and an AlN substrate. The SiO2 layer is sandwiched between the substrate and thermocouples, and allows the measurement of temperature differences arising from the difference in thermal conductivity between the substrate and the SiO2 layer. A protective layer with a sandwich structure prevents the tungsten-rhenium thin film from oxidizing at high temperatures in air. This small HFS with a protective layer can survive for 1 h in 1000°C air. Calibration data show that the HFS exhibits repeatable and fast thermal responses when a pulsed heat flux of 1000 kW/ $\\textm^2<sup>-6$</sup> V/(kW/ $\\textm^2$ ). The experimental data agree with the simulated results. It can be concluded from the experimental results that the tungsten-rhenium thin film has a good thermoelectric response to high temperatures after the size is reduced to a micron. Thus the developed HFS can be a suitable alternative for applications in thermal systems, such as engines, turbines, and rockets.","author":[{"family":"Fu","given":"Xiaoli"},{"family":"Lin","given":"Qiyu"},{"family":"Peng","given":"Yongqing"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Jianhua"},{"family":"Yang","given":"Xiaofei"},{"family":"Zhu","given":"Benpeng"},{"family":"Ouyang","given":"Jun"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Yue"},{"family":"Xu","given":"Liangcai"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Shi"}],"citation-key":"fuHighTemperatureHeatFlux2020","container-title":"IEEE Sensors Journal","DOI":"10/gr26fn","ISSN":"1558-1748","issue":"18","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,9]]},"page":"10444-10452","source":"IEEE Xplore","title":"High-Temperature Heat Flux Sensor Based on Tungsten–Rhenium Thin-Film Thermocouple","type":"article-journal","volume":"20"},

  {"id":"gatskiChapterMeasurementAnalysis2009","abstract":"This chapter discusses the constraints imposed by compressibility on measurement and analysis strategies for turbulent flows at high speeds when compared to incompressible situations. The major characteristics arising from high-speed compressibility are the coexistence of several fluctuating fields (having both dynamic and thermodynamic properties) and the associated modes, the presence of shocks, and the wide bandwidths. These characteristics can impose severe limitations of the measurement capabilities of the methods more widely developed, optimized, and used in incompressible regimes. The unique influence compressibility has on these methods and procedures is highlighted in the chapter. Although the topics of measurements and analyses may appear focused to physical experimentalists, the material is applicable to both laboratory (physical) and numerical experiments. For the laboratory experiments, it is important in their design that the orders of magnitude of the flow quantities that characterize the physics be established, and their impact on the measurement methods identified. For the numerical experiments, which are often used in either the prediction or validation of the physical experiment, it is crucial that the physical experiment be properly replicated. In this context, there are three factors that should be considered in formulating the numerical problem: constraints imposed on the experimental study, limitations on the data collected, and accurate replication of boundary conditions and parameterizations.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,6,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Gatski","given":"Thomas B."},{"family":"Bonnet","given":"Jean-Paul"}],"citation-key":"gatskiChapterMeasurementAnalysis2009","container-title":"Compressibility, Turbulence and High Speed Flow","DOI":"10.1016/B978-0-08-044565-6.00009-9","editor":[{"family":"Gatski","given":"Thomas B."},{"family":"Bonnet","given":"Jean-Paul"}],"event-place":"Amsterdam","ISBN":"978-0-08-044565-6","issued":{"date-parts":[[2009,1,1]]},"language":"en","page":"79-116","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher-place":"Amsterdam","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Chapter 4 - Measurement and analysis strategies","type":"chapter","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780080445656000099"},

The sensor structure is composed of three parallel substrate-free wires presenting a high aspect ratio and supported by periodic perpendicular SiO2 micro-bridges. This hybrid structure takes advantages from both conventional hot-films and hot-wires, ensuring near-wall and non-intrusive measurement, mechanical toughness and thermal insulation to the bulk substrate, and it allowed to add the calorimetric sensor functionality to detect simultaneously the wall shear stress amplitude and direction. The central wire is made of a multilayer structure composed of a heater element (Au/Ti) and a thermistor (Ni/Pt/Ni/Pt/Ni) enabling measurement of the heater temperature and a layer of SiO2 between them for electrical insulation. The upstream and downstream wires are thermistors enabling operation in the calorimetric mode. This design provides a high temperature gradient and a homogeneous temperature distribution along the wires. The sensor operates in both constant current and constant temperature modes, with a feedback on current enabled by uncoupling heating and measurement. Welded on a flexible printed circuit, the sensor was flush mounted on the wall of a turbulent boundary layer wind tunnel.

Fifteen sensor prototypes are first calibrated in a range of ±2Pa to generate an experimental database for validation of the subsequent numerical investigation. Then, a fully parameterized numerical setup is used to investigate the effect of three geometric design parameters, namely the cavity height, the cavity width, and the inter-beam distance, on amplitude and sensitivity of the sensor. This is done by building a surrogate model based on Gaussian Process interpolation (Kriging) in the four-dimensional space consisting of the three design parameters and the shear velocity in the flow. Thanks to this methodology, the calibration curves of all possible sensor designs in the investigated range can be estimated with an error of less than 2%. A detailed study of this model reveals that the most significant design parameters are the inter-beam distance and the cavity width, while the cavity height is found to be of minor importance.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,6,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Giehler","given":"Julian"},{"family":"Chamard","given":"Léo"},{"family":"Ebert","given":"Carola"},{"family":"Weiss","given":"Julien"},{"family":"Giani","given":"Alain"},{"family":"Combette","given":"Philippe"}],"citation-key":"giehlerSurrogatebasedParameterExploration2022","container-title":"Sensors and Actuators A: Physical","container-title-short":"Sensors and Actuators A: Physical","DOI":"10/gsdf2f","ISSN":"0924-4247","issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,11,1]]},"language":"en","page":"113949","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Surrogate-based parameter exploration for the design of MEMS calorimetric wall shear stress sensors by means of CFD","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0924424722005842","volume":"347"},

  {"id":"gimenoSyntheticJetsBased2010","abstract":"A magneto-mechanical micro-actuator providing an axisymmetric synthetic microjet for active flow control was designed, fabricated and characterized. The micro-actuator consists of an enclosed cavity with a small orifice in one face and a high flexible elastomeric (PDMS) membrane in the opposite one. The membrane vibration is achieved using a magnetic actuation chosen for its capacity for providing large out of plane displacements and forces necessary for the performances aimed for. The paper presents first numerical simulations of the flow performed during the design process in order to identify a general jet formation criterion and optimize the device's performances. The fabrication process of this micro-magneto-mechanical system (MMMS) is then briefly described. The full size of the device, including packaging and actuation, does not exceed 1 cm3. The evaluation of the performances of the synthetic jet with 600 µm orifice was performed. The results show that the optimum working point is in the frequency range 400–700 Hz which is in accordance with the frequency response of the magnet-membrane mechanical resonator. In this frequency range, the microjet reaches maximum speeds ranging from 25 m s−1 to 55 m s−1 for an electromagnetic power consumption of 500 mW.

Minimally invasive therapy aims to reduce the damage done to healthy tissue by reaching the affected area through existing pathways through the body. However, information is scarce as direct view or touch is lacking. Small sensors are needed on catheters inside the blood vessels to gather the data such as blood pressure and flow. To this end a combined pressure and flow sensor is fabricated in an epi-poly process that uses a 4 micrometer thick polysilicon membrane grown during epitaxial growth, to form the diaphragm of the pressure sensor and the thermal insulation of the thermal flow sensor. Using RIE etching of holes through the membrane, sacrificial etching and closing of the etch holes by oxide depositions, a closed reference chamber is formed for an absolute pressure sensor. The process is compatible with standard bipolar electronics to enable integration of signal conditioning, multiplexing, etc. Measurements of the two sensors show that fabrication of flow and pressure sensors using epi-micromachining is possible and that the sensors have the required measurement range, but drift necessitates calibration before use.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,6,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Goosen","given":"Hans F."},{"family":"French","given":"Patrick J."},{"family":"Sarro","given":"Pasqualina M."}],"citation-key":"goosenPressureFlowSensor1999","DOI":"10/cqh8zq","editor":[{"family":"French","given":"Patrick J."},{"family":"Peeters","given":"Eric"}],"event-place":"Santa Clara, CA","event-title":"Symposium on Micromachining and Microfabrication","issued":{"date-parts":[[1999,8,31]]},"page":"38-45","publisher-place":"Santa Clara, CA","source":"Semantic Scholar","title":"Pressure and flow sensor for use in catheters","type":"paper-conference","URL":"http://proceedings.spiedigitallibrary.org/proceeding.aspx?articleid=911999"},

The sensor design corresponds to the calorimetric principle. The multi-parameter detection is achieved by the use of two time independent excitation modes (power and temperature). Due to the developed sensor design, a flow independent, but gas sensitive region is obtained in power mode. In this flow range, the thermal conductivity is measured by analyzing the temperature of the downstream element. Gas concentration of the binary gas mixture is derived from the theoretical relationship to thermal conductivity. Afterwards, the flow rate is detected by evaluating the temperature difference between the down- and upstream temperature sensors in temperature excitation mode. This measurement technique has been successfully proven under laboratory conditions, where a flowing mixture of e.g. methane and carbon dioxide has been analyzed. The carried out measurements show an accuracy of ±5% in gas concentration and of ±3.3% in flow rate. This measuring method seems to be sufficient to analyze biogas in anaerobic distinctions.

It is shown that electroplated noble metal films have lower stresses than sputtered films, due to larger grain sizes.","author":[{"family":"Hodge","given":"T.C."},{"family":"Bidstrup-Allen","given":"S.A."},{"family":"Kohl","given":"P.A."}],"citation-key":"hodgeStressesThinFilm1997","container-title":"IEEE Transactions on Components, Packaging, and Manufacturing Technology: Part A","DOI":"10/cd4r53","ISSN":"1558-3678","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[1997,6]]},"page":"241-250","source":"IEEE Xplore","title":"Stresses in thin film metallization","type":"article-journal","volume":"20"},

Since the pioneer work of Duval 70 years ago, the scientific community has agreed unanimously as to the decomposition of anhydrous calcium oxalate (CaC2O4) into calcium carbonate (CaCO3) and CO gas, and that of the calcium carbonate into calcium oxide (CaO), and CO2 gas. We will demonstrate how these reactions, simple in appearance, in fact result from a succession of reactive phenomena involving numerous constituents both solid (CaCO3, free carbon) and gaseous (CO2 and CO) produced by intermediary reactions. The mass losses evaluated in the two distinct domains correspond closely to the molar masses of CO and CO2, respectively. The simple mathematical calculation of that mass loss has simply concealed the existence of other reactions, and, most particularly the Boudouard reaction and that of solid phases between CaCO3 and C.

The new model computes the wall shear stress and the vertical derivatives of the streamwise velocity component by means of a modified, instantaneous, and local law-of-the-wall formulation. By formulating a correction for the modeled shear stress, using experimental findings of a logarithmic region in the streamwise turbulent fluctuations, the need for a filter is eliminated. This allows one to model the wall shear stress locally, and at the same time accurately recover the correct average value. The proposed model has been applied to both unique high Reynolds number experimental data and a suite of large-eddy simulations, and compared to previous models. It is shown that the proposed model performs equally well or better than the previous filtered models. A nonfiltered model, such as the one proposed, is an essential first step in developing a universal wall shear stress model that can be used for flow over heterogeneous surfaces, studies of diurnal cycles, or analyses of flow over complex terrain.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,6,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Hultmark","given":"Marcus"},{"family":"Calaf","given":"Marc"},{"family":"Parlange","given":"Marc B."}],"citation-key":"hultmarkNewWallShear2013","container-title":"Journal of the Atmospheric Sciences","DOI":"10/f5ff6f","ISSN":"0022-4928, 1520-0469","issue":"11","issued":{"date-parts":[[2013,11,1]]},"language":"EN","page":"3460-3470","publisher":"American Meteorological Society","section":"Journal of the Atmospheric Sciences","source":"journals.ametsoc.org","title":"A New Wall Shear Stress Model for Atmospheric Boundary Layer Simulations","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/atsc/70/11/jas-d-12-0257.1.xml","volume":"70"},

A 3 mm diameter membrane was used as the flow barrier, and the opening mechanism was based on cracking the membrane by inducing thermal stresses on it with fast and localized resistive heating. Four manufacturing schemes based on high-temperature co-fired ceramic technology were studied. Three designs for the integrated heaters and two thicknesses of 40 and 120 μm for the membranes were considered, and the heat distribution over their membranes, the required heating energies, their opening mode, and the flows admitted through were compared. Furthermore, the effect of applying +1 and −1 bar pressure difference on the membrane during cracking was investigated. Thick membranes demonstrated unpromising results for low-pressure applications since the heating either resulted in microcracks or cracking of the whole chip. Because of the higher pressure tolerance of the thick membranes, the design with microcracks can be considered for high-pressure applications where flow is facilitated anyway. Thin membranes, on the other hand, showed different opening sizes depending on heater design and, consequently, heat distribution over the membranes, from microcracks to holes with sizes of 3–100% of the membrane area. For all the designs, applying +1 bar over pressure contributed to bigger openings, whereas −1 bar pressure difference only did so for one of the designs, resulting in smaller openings for the other two. The energy required for breaking these membranes was a few hundred mJ with no significant dependence on design and applied pressure. The maximum sustainable pressure of the valve for the current design and thin membranes was 7 bar.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,2,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Khaji","given":"Z."},{"family":"Klintberg","given":"L."},{"family":"Thornell","given":"G."}],"citation-key":"khajiManufacturingCharacterizationCeramic2016","container-title":"Journal of Micromechanics and Microengineering","container-title-short":"J.

An antiphase domain (APD) free 3C-SiC layer was used showing a roughness limited to 1 nm. This leads to a smooth Si film with a roughness of only 3 nm for a film thickness of 400 nm. The number of rotation domains in the Si(110) epilayer was found to be two on this APD-free 3C-SiC surface. This is attributed to the in-plane azimuthal misalignment of the mirror planes between the two involved materials. We prove that fundamentally no further reduction of the number of domains can be expected for the given substrate.

Kapton films were pyrolyzed in an inert atmosphere to produce carbon-based residues with varying degree of conversion to free sp2 disordered carbon. The thermal conductivity of carbon materials ranges from 0.2 to 2 W m−1 K−1, depending on the temperature of the carbonization process (varied between 500 and 1200 °C). For quantitative measurements of thermal conductivity, the Null Point SThM (NP-SThM) technique is used in order to avoid unwanted effects as the parasitic heat flows through the air and the probe cantilever. It was found that NP SThM data for bulk materials are in excellent agreement with results obtained through more traditional techniques, namely, photo-thermal radiometry, flash laser analysis, and micro-Raman thermometry.

  {"id":"kreiderAuThinFilms2022","abstract":"Plasmonic sensors provide label-free detection of bio and chemical targets with ultrahigh sensitivity and accuracy. However, they usually lack the ability to operate at high temperatures, producing large measurement errors due to perturbations. Here, we report a surface plasmon resonance sensor based on Al–Au thin films, which outperforms its conventional Au counterpart by providing a temperature-stable response. We fabricate six metallic samples via the co-sputtering depositing method, obtaining four bimetallic thin films and two pure metals. Through spectroscopic ellipsometry, transmission measurements, and scanning electron microscopy images, we obtain their dielectric function and film morphology from room temperature to 200 °C, showing that the films containing Al do not undergo significant changes with increasing temperature. We experimentally and theoretically establish the dispersion relation of Al–Au alloys by varying the film chemical composition. Using the transfer matrix method, we evaluate the performance of the sensors by studying their response in the refractive index measurement of air, water, and a biological environment. We show that all alloys outperform their pure counterparts, achieving maximum theoretical sensitivities of 42411 nm/RIU and 162.7 °/RIU for a Au0.62Al0.38-based wavelength-dependent sensor and a Au0.85Al0.15-based angular-dependent sensor, respectively. We find that Au0.85Al0.15 is a particularly promising candidate for both wavelength- and angular-dependent sensors due to its high sensitivity (18967 nm/RIU and 162.7 °/RIU) and good peak definition. Furthermore, using partial density-of-state calculations assisted by machine learning, we obtain the dielectric function of the films, showing an excellent agreement with our experimental results. The alloying approach assisted by computational prediction of the samples’ physical properties has the potential to accelerate the discovery of novel materials for plasmonic sensors with high sensitivity and excellent functioning capabilities at elevated temperatures.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,2,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Kreider","given":"Molly Kate"},{"family":"Rehan","given":"Abdul Qadeer"},{"family":"Kent","given":"Robert.

The use of SiC for high temperature applications in space, high temperature CMOS, high radiation hard detectors, new optical devices, high frequency MEMS, new devices with integrated 2D materials and biosensors have been extensively reviewed in this paper. The development of these new applications, at least for the 4H-SiC ones, has been favored by the strong improvement in SiC technology and in the material quality and price, due to the increasing market for power devices. However, at the same time, these new applications need the development of new processes and the improvement of material properties (high temperature packages, channel mobility and threshold voltage instability improvement, thick epitaxial layers, low defects, long carrier lifetime, low epitaxial doping). Instead, in the case of 3C-SiC applications, several new projects have developed material processes to obtain more performing MEMS, photonics and biomedical devices.

  {"id":"linExperimentsSimulationsMEMS2004","abstract":"MEMS thermal shear-stress sensors exploit heat-transfer effects to measure the shear stress exerted by an air flow on its solid boundary, and have promising applications in aerodynamic control. Classical theory for conventional, macroscale thermal shear-stress sensors states that the rate of heat removed by the flow from the sensor is proportional to the 1/3-power of the shear stress. However, we have observed that this theory is inconsistent with experimental data from MEMS sensors. This paper seeks to develop an understanding of MEMS thermal shear-stress sensors through a study including both experimental and theoretical investigations. We first obtain experimental data that confirm the inadequacy of the classical theory by wind-tunnel testing of prototype MEMS shear-stress sensors with different dimensions and materials. A theoretical analysis is performed to identify that this inadequacy is due to the lack of a thin thermal boundary layer in the fluid flow at the sensor surface, and then a two-dimensional MEMS shear-stress sensor theory is presented. This theory incorporates important heat-transfer effects that are ignored by the classical theory, and consistently explains the experimental data obtained from prototype MEMS sensors. Moreover, the prototype MEMS sensors are studied with three-dimensional simulations, yielding results that quantitatively agree with experimental data. This work demonstrates that classical assumptions made for conventional thermal devices should be carefully examined for miniature MEMS devices.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,12,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Lin","given":"Qiao"},{"family":"Jiang","given":"Fukang"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Xuan-Qi"},{"family":"Xu","given":"Yong"},{"family":"Han","given":"Zhigang"},{"family":"Tai","given":"Yu-Chong"},{"family":"Lew","given":"James"},{"family":"Ho","given":"Chih-Ming"}],"citation-key":"linExperimentsSimulationsMEMS2004","container-title":"Journal of Micromechanics and Microengineering","container-title-short":"J.

The sensors are made in SOI (silicon on insulator) wafers leading to a very simple fabrication process. The use of relatively thick single crystal silicon for the in plane bridges result in structures with good mechanical properties as compared to alternative surface micromachining processes and reduces problems with buckling and sticking. Since, the proposed Pirani has three heat sinks, the area of heat loss through the ambient gas is greatly enlarged as compared to Pirani sensors with one or two heat sinks, without increasing the size of the sensor. Consequently, a Pirani sensor of 336μm in length has a pressure measurement range of 0.08–200Torr. Alternative designs have shown measurement ranges varying between 0.02 and 500Torr.

  {"id":"liuMultipleDegreeFreedom2007","abstract":"The development of a tunable, multiple degree of freedom (MDOF) electromechanical Helmholtz resonator (EMHR) is presented. An EMHR consists of an orifice, backing cavity, and a compliant piezoelectric composite diaphragm. Electromechanical tuning of the acoustic impedance is achieved via passive electrical networks shunted across the piezoceramic. For resistive and capacitive loads, the EMHR is a 2DOF system possessing one acoustic and one mechanical DOF. When inductive ladder networks are employed, multiple electrical DOF are added. The dynamics of the multi-energy domain system are modeled using lumped elements and are represented in an equivalent electrical circuit, which is used to analyze the tunable acoustic input impedance of the EMHR. The two-microphone method is used to measure the acoustic impedance of two EMHR designs with a variety of resistive, capacitive, and inductive shunts. For the first design, the data demonstrate that the tuning range of the second resonant frequency for an EMHR with non-inductive shunts is limited by short- and open-circuit conditions, while an inductive shunt results in a 3DOF system possessing an enhanced tuning range. The second design achieves stronger coupling between the Helmholtz resonator and the piezoelectric backplate, and both resonant frequencies can be tuned with different non-inductive loads.","author":[{"family":"Liu","given":"Fei"},{"family":"Horowitz","given":"Stephen"},{"family":"Nishida","given":"Toshikazu"},{"family":"Cattafesta","given":"Louis"},{"family":"Sheplak","given":"Mark"}],"citation-key":"liuMultipleDegreeFreedom2007","container-title":"The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America","container-title-short":"The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America","DOI":"10/fdcn9c","issued":{"date-parts":[[2007,8,1]]},"note":"Read_Status: To Read\nRead_Status_Date: 2023-01-23T14:09:51.416Z","page":"291-301","source":"ResearchGate","title":"A multiple degree of freedom electromechanical Helmholtz resonator","type":"article-journal","volume":"122"},

A typical MEMS sensor is at least one order of magnitude smaller than traditional sensors used to measure instantaneous flow quantities such as pressure and velocity. The microsensors can resolve all relevant scales even in high-Reynolds-number turbulent flows, and arrays of microsensors make it feasible, for the first time, to achieve complete information on the effective small-scale coherent structures in turbulent wall-bounded flows. In this paper we focus on the use of MEMS for the diagnosis of turbulent shear flows and survey the status and outlook of microsensors as used for measurements of fluctuating wall pressure and wall shear stress, two quantities which we deem particularly difficult to measure with conventional probes.

These include high values of Young's modulus, hardness, tensile strength and high thermal conductivity, low thermal expansion coefficient combined with low coefficients of friction and good wear resistance. As a consequence, they are finding increasing applications in micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS). This paper reviews these distinctive material properties from an engineering design point of view and highlights the applications of diamond and DLC materials in various MEMS devices. Applications of diamond and DLC films in MEMS are in two categories: surface coatings and structural materials. Thin diamond and DLC layers have been used as coatings mainly to improve the wear and friction of micro-components and to reduce stiction between microstructures and their substrates. The high values of the elastic modulus of diamond and DLC have been exploited in the design of high frequency resonators and comb-drives for communication and sensing applications. Chemically modified surfaces and structures of diamond and DLC films have both been utilized as sensor materials for sensing traces of gases, to detect bio-molecules for biological research and disease diagnosis.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,4,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Luo","given":"J.

  {"id":"michaud3CSiCElectronicMEMS2015","abstract":"Since decades, silicon carbide (SiC) has been avowed as an interesting material for high-power and high-temperature applications because of its significant properties including its wide bandgap energy and high temperature stability. SiC is also professed as an ideal candidate for microsystem applications due to its excellent mechanical properties and chemical inertia, making it suitable for harsh environments. Among the 250 different SiC polytypes, only 4H, 6H and 3C-SiC are commercially available. The cubic structure, 3C-SiC, is the only one that can be grown on cheap silicon substrates. Hence, 3C-SiC is more interesting than any other polytype for reducing fabrication costs and increasing wafer diameter. This huge property has been evidenced for more than 30 years using chemical vapor deposition. Despite this key achievement and the growing interest for silicon carbide, no 3C-SiC-based devices can be found on the market whereas 4H-SiC-based devices are more and more largely commercialized. Even so, important headways have been reached for electrical and microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) applications.\nTherefore, the purpose of this chapter is to address concerns related to electronic applications and MEMS fabrication of 3C-SiC-based devices, trying to give a broad overview on specific issues and challenging solutions.","author":[{"family":"Michaud","given":"Jean-Francois"},{"family":"Portail","given":"Marc"},{"family":"Alquier","given":"Daniel"}],"citation-key":"michaud3CSiCElectronicMEMS2015","DOI":"10.5772/61020","ISBN":"978-953-51-2168-8","issued":{"date-parts":[[2015,9,17]]},"page":"33-60","source":"ResearchGate","title":"3C-SiC — From Electronic to MEMS Devices","type":"chapter"},

  {"id":"michaudNovel3CSiCMicrostructure2016","abstract":"The aim of this paper is to review the recent developments conducted for the achievement of 3C-SiC‑based heterostructures compatible with MEMS applications. Indeed, the research activities engaged since years permitted to demonstrate that the defect density has an impact towards the Young’s modulus of sub-micron 3C‑SiC epilayers. We also gained knowledge about the stress relaxation mechanisms, targeting to master the stress gradient, as stress is a key parameter to consider MEMS applications.Based on these results, we investigated the elaboration of microstructures using 3C‑SiC/Si/3C‑SiC stacks on silicon substrates. Our first noticeable result was the elaboration of a (110)-oriented 3C‑SiC membrane on a 3C‑SiC pseudo-substrate, using the silicon epilayer as a sacrificial one. But the surface of the 3C‑SiC membrane was facetted and rough, which could hamper its use for the development of new MEMS devices. Then, with further improvements, we succeeded to master the growth of a (111)‑oriented 3C‑SiC epilayer. This feature led to a drastic reduction of the roughness in comparison with the (110) orientation. Actually, using the same experimental protocol than previously, we succeeded to complete a (111)‑oriented 3C‑SiC membrane with a RMS roughness limited to 9nm. Such an optimized structure could be the starting point for the achievement of new MEMS devices operating in harsh environment or for medical applications benefiting of the 3C‑SiC biocompatibility","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,7,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Michaud","given":"Jean François"},{"family":"Portail","given":"Marc"},{"family":"Khazaka","given":"Rami"},{"family":"Zielinski","given":"Marcin"},{"family":"Chassagne","given":"Thierry"},{"family":"Alquier","given":"Daniel"}],"citation-key":"michaudNovel3CSiCMicrostructure2016","container-title":"Materials Science Forum","DOI":"10/gsg37c","ISSN":"1662-9752","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016]]},"language":"en","page":"723-728","publisher":"Trans Tech Publications Ltd","source":"www.scientific.net","title":"Novel 3C-SiC Microstructure for MEMS Applications","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.scientific.net/MSF.858.723","volume":"858"},

The differential capacitive microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) sensor is fabricated using\na novel, low-cost approach to creating backside electrical contacts, providing a hydraulically smooth surface without the use of through-silicon vias. Fully-differential sensor electronics provide improved common-mode rejection, increased shear stress sensitivity, and reduced minimum detectable signal, thus increasing the dynamic range of the sensing system. A differential charge amplifier provides improved performance compared to both single-ended buffer and differential voltage amplifier configurations. Initial characterization of the sensor system with a differential charge amplifier yields a wall shear stress sensitivity of 196.0 mV/Pa and a minimum detectable signal of 12.8 μPa at 1 kHz, providing a dynamic range of 138 dB based on a 100 Pa maximum shear stress. Dynamic calibration also provides a pressure rejection ratio of 101.9 dB, representing a significant reduction in pressure sensitivity for the current sensor design. Stability testing of the system for mean shear stress measurement demonstrates a measurement accuracy of ±0.032% full scale (±3.2 mPa) over a 60 min period.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,11,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Mills","given":"David A."},{"family":"Patterson","given":"William C."},{"family":"Keane","given":"Casey"},{"family":"Sheplak","given":"Mark"}],"citation-key":"millsCharacterizationFullyDifferentialCapacitive2018","collection-title":"AIAA SciTech Forum","container-title":"2018  AIAA Aerospace Sciences Meeting","DOI":"10.2514/6.2018-0301","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,1,7]]},"note":"Read_Status: To Read\nRead_Status_Date: 2023-01-23T14:09:51.414Z","publisher":"American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics","source":"arc.aiaa.org (Atypon)","title":"Characterization of a Fully-Differential Capacitive Wall Shear Stress Sensor for Low-Speed Wind Tunnels","type":"chapter","URL":"https://arc.aiaa.org/doi/10.2514/6.2018-0301"},

The study was carried out in a turbulent channel flow facility. One array of 25 micro-shear stress sensors in the chip that covers a length of 7.5 mm is used to measure the instantaneous span-wise distribution of the surface shear stress. The characteristics of high shear stress area (streaks) were described with statistics. Based on the measurement, the physical quantities associated with the high shear stress streaks, such as their length, width with the high shear stress level, were obtained. To further explore the relationship between the shear stress slope and the peak shear stress, the probability density function (PDF) of the ratio of peak shear stress to shear stress slope at different Reynolds number Re is examined. As for the distribution of PDF, it was found that the distribution concentrated towards a certain value in each Re. This result is extremely important because it points to the possibility of predicting the peak shear stress level based on the shear stress distribution at the leading edge of the streaks.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,6,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Miyagi","given":"Norimasa"},{"family":"Kimura","given":"Motoaki"},{"family":"Shoji","given":"Hideo"},{"family":"Saima","given":"Atsusi"},{"family":"Ho","given":"Chih-Ming"},{"family":"Tung","given":"Steve"},{"family":"Tai","given":"Yu-Chong"}],"citation-key":"miyagiStatisticalAnalysisWall2000","collection-title":"Turbulence and Shear Flow Phenomena 1","container-title":"International Journal of Heat and Fluid Flow","container-title-short":"International Journal of Heat and Fluid Flow","DOI":"10/cc7xkj","ISSN":"0142-727X","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[[2000,10,1]]},"language":"en","page":"576-581","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Statistical analysis on wall shear stress of turbulent boundary layer in a channel flow using micro-shear stress imager","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0142727X00000473","volume":"21"},

One such area of concern is the rising number of accidents happening due to gas leaks at coal mines, chemical industries, home appliances etc. In this paper we propose a novel approach to detect and identify the gaseous emissions using the multimodal AI fusion techniques. Most of the gases and their fumes are colorless, odorless, and tasteless, thereby challenging our normal human senses. Sensing based on a single sensor may not be accurate, and sensor fusion is essential for robust and reliable detection in several real-world applications. We manually collected 6400 gas samples (1600 samples per class for four classes) using two specific sensors: the 7-semiconductor gas sensors array, and a thermal camera. The early fusion method of multimodal AI, is applied The network architecture consists of a feature extraction module for individual modality, which is then fused using a merged layer followed by a dense layer, which provides a single output for identifying the gas. We obtained the testing accuracy of 96% (for fused model) as opposed to individual model accuracies of 82% (based on Gas Sensor data using LSTM) and 93% (based on thermal images data using CNN model).

The sensor layout has been optimized to exploit the layers of the original process in order to enhance the sensor performance. The sensors exhibit a resolution better than 0.4Pa from nearly 0.3Pa to 1kPa and better than 50Pa from 1kPa to 100kPa. The sensor response at the lower extreme of the pressure interval is marked by an offset voltage, which is three orders of magnitude smaller than the full-scale value.

The structural and electrical properties of the films were investigated. For film thicknesses below 300 nm, the 3C-SiC material deposited on 2H-AlN/Si presented a better structural quality than the 3C-SiC films grown directly on Si(111) using the well-established two-step carbonization–epitaxy process. The good lattice match of 3C-SiC with AlN may open a reliable route towards high-quality thin heteroepitaxial 3C-SiC films on a silicon wafer. Nevertheless, the 3C-SiC was featured by the presence of twinned domains and small inclusions of 6H-SiC. The formation of a thin AlSiN film at the AlN/Si interface is also reported. This is the first time such AlSiN layers are described within an AlN/Si heterostructure. Furthermore, noticeable modifications were observed in the AlN film. First, the growth process of SiC on AlN induced a reduction of the dislocation density in the AlN, attesting to the structural healing of AlN with thermal treatment, as already observed for other AlN-based heterostructures with higher-temperature processes. The growth of SiC on AlN also induced a dramatic reduction in the insulating character of the AlN, which could be related to a noticeable cross-doping between the materials.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,6,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Portail","given":"Marc"},{"family":"Frayssinet","given":"Eric"},{"family":"Michon","given":"Adrien"},{"family":"Rennesson","given":"Stéphanie"},{"family":"Semond","given":"Fabrice"},{"family":"Courville","given":"Aimeric"},{"family":"Zielinski","given":"Marcin"},{"family":"Comyn","given":"Remi"},{"family":"Nguyen","given":"Luan"},{"family":"Cordier","given":"Yvon"},{"family":"Vennéguès","given":"Philippe"}],"citation-key":"portailCVDElaboration3CSiC2022","container-title":"Crystals","DOI":"10/gsdbzv","ISSN":"2073-4352","issue":"11","issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,11]]},"language":"en","license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","number":"11","page":"1605","publisher":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","source":"www.mdpi.com","title":"CVD Elaboration of 3C-SiC on AlN/Si Heterostructures: Structural Trends and Evolution during Growth","title-short":"CVD Elaboration of 3C-SiC on AlN/Si Heterostructures","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4352/12/11/1605","volume":"12"},

Test results demonstrate the sensor achieving a resolution of 350 mg/√Hz at 1kHz with a sensitivity of 12 μV/g and a bandwidth of 10 kHz at room temperature.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,6,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Rajgopal","given":"Srihari"},{"family":"Zula","given":"Daniel"},{"family":"Garverick","given":"Steven"},{"family":"Mehregany","given":"Mehran"}],"citation-key":"rajgopalSiliconCarbideAccelerometer2009","container-title":"Materials Science Forum","DOI":"10/fgqp7t","ISSN":"1662-9752","issued":{"date-parts":[[2009]]},"language":"en","page":"859-862","publisher":"Trans Tech Publications Ltd","source":"www.scientific.net","title":"A Silicon Carbide Accelerometer for Extreme Environment Applications","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.scientific.net/MSF.600-603.859","volume":"600-603"},

This paper focuses on optimization of the boron doping of low-pressure chemical vapor deposited polysilicon resistors for obtaining near-zero TCR and development of a physical model that explains quantitatively all the results obtained in the optimization experiments encompassing the doping concentration ranges that show negative, near-zero, and positive TCR values in the polysilicon resistors. The proposed model considers single-crystal silicon grain in equilibrium with amorphous silicon grain boundary. The grain boundary carrier concentration is calculated considering exponential band tails in the density of states for amorphous silicon in the grain boundaries. Comparison of the results from the model shows excellent agreement with the measured values of resistivity as well as TCR for heavily doped polysilicon. It is shown that the trap density for holes in the grain boundary increases as the square root of the doping concentration, which is consistent with the defect compensation model of doping in the amorphous silicon grain boundaries.","author":[{"family":"Raman","given":"M.S."},{"family":"Kifle","given":"T."},{"family":"Bhattacharya","given":"E."},{"family":"Bhat","given":"K.N."}],"citation-key":"ramanPhysicalModelResistivity2006","container-title":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","DOI":"10/d5c47k","ISSN":"1557-9646","issue":"8","issued":{"date-parts":[[2006,8]]},"page":"1885-1892","source":"IEEE Xplore","title":"Physical Model for the Resistivity and Temperature Coefficient of Resistivity in Heavily Doped Polysilicon","type":"article-journal","volume":"53"},

He set out in this book a detailed algorithm for systematic numerical weather prediction. The method of computing atmospheric changes, which he mapped out in great detail in this book, is essentially the method used today. He was greatly ahead of his time because, before his ideas could bear fruit, advances in four critical areas were needed: better understanding of the dynamics of the atmosphere; stable computational algorithms to integrate the equations; regular observations of the free atmosphere; and powerful automatic computer equipment. Over the ensuing years, progress in numerical weather prediction has been dramatic. Weather prediction and climate modelling have now reached a high level of sophistication, and are witness to the influence of Richardson's ideas.

  {"id":"romijnMultilayerGraphenePirani2021","abstract":"The operating principle of Pirani pressure sensors is based on the pressure dependence of a suspended strip’s electrical conductivity, caused by the thermal conductance of the surrounding gas which changes the Joule heating of the strip. To realize such sensors, not only materials with high temperature dependent electrical conductivity are required, but also minimization of the suspended strip dimensions is essential to maximize the responsivity and minimize the power consumption. Due to this, nanomaterials are especially attractive for this application. Here, we demonstrate the use of a multi-layer suspended graphene strip as a Pirani pressure sensor and compare its behavior with existing models. A clear pressure dependence of the strip’s electrical resistance is observed, with a maximum relative change of 2.75% between 1 and 1000 mbar and a power consumption of 8.5 mW. The use of graphene enables miniaturization of the device footprint by 100 times compared to state-of-the-art. Moreover, miniaturization allows for lower power consumption and/or higher responsivity and the sensor’s nanogap enables operation near atmospheric pressure that can be used in applications such as barometers for altitude measurement. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the sensor response depends on the type of gas molecules, which opens up the way to selective gas sensing applications. Finally, the graphene synthesis technology is compatible with wafer-scale fabrication, potentially enabling future chip-level integration with readout electronics.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,6,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Romijn","given":"Joost"},{"family":"Dolleman","given":"Robin J."},{"family":"Singh","given":"Manvika"},{"family":"Zant","given":"Herre S.

Both investigations followed the feedback flow control approach laid out in this paper; however, because of the very different flowfields and control goals, different techniques were selected for developing the most effective control strategy. The flow instabilities on the tangent ogive made this flow a good candidate for effective flow control. Unforced computational and experimental data showed the relevant flow features. With only four pressure sensors, the relevant flow features were controlled, and a prescribed side force signal could be tracked. For the shear layer, the control goal was to reduce the optical path difference, a control goal that cannot easily be observed in experiment or simulation. Using a wavenet autoregressive exogenous model, a reduction in optical path difference of 40% was achieved using a sensor array colocated with the aperture. Open-loop simulations showed the need to capture the effect of forcing startup and shutdown. Adaptive feedback resulted in a new flow state that the open-loop data had not captured.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,1,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Seidel","given":"Jürgen"},{"family":"Fagley","given":"Casey"},{"family":"McLaughlin","given":"Thomas"}],"citation-key":"seidelFeedbackFlowControl2018","container-title":"AIAA Journal","DOI":"10/gfjmn6","ISSN":"0001-1452","issue":"10","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,10]]},"note":"Read_Status: To Read\nRead_Status_Date: 2023-01-23T14:43:42.238Z","page":"3825-3834","publisher":"American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics","source":"arc.aiaa.org (Atypon)","title":"Feedback Flow Control: A Heuristic Approach","title-short":"Feedback Flow Control","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://arc.aiaa.org/doi/10.2514/1.J056884","volume":"56"},

  {"id":"simonFastresponseHotwireFlow2022","abstract":"Due to limitations in available sensor technology, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) lack an active sensing capability to measure turbulence, gusts, or other unsteady aerodynamic phenomena. Conventional in situ anemometry techniques fail to deliver in the harsh and dynamic multirotor environment due to form factor, resolution, or robustness requirements. To address this capability gap, a novel, fast-response sensor system to measure a wind vector in two dimensions is introduced and evaluated. This system, known as ‘MAST’ (for MEMS Anemometry Sensing Tower), leverages advances in microelectromechanical (MEMS) hot-wire devices to produce a solid-state, lightweight, and robust flow sensor suitable for real-time wind estimation onboard an UAV. The MAST uses five pentagonally-arranged microscale hot-wires to determine the wind vector’s direction and magnitude. The MAST’s performance was evaluated in a wind tunnel at speeds up to 5 m s−1 and orientations of 0∘–360∘. A neural network sensor model was trained from the wind tunnel data to estimate the wind vector from sensor signals. The average error of the sensor is 0.14 m s−1 for speed and 1.6∘ for direction. Furthermore, 95% of measurements are within 0.36 m s−1 for speed and 5.0∘ for direction. With a bandwidth of 570 Hz determined from square-wave testing, the MAST stands to greatly enhance UAV wind estimation capabilities and enable capturing relevant high-frequency phenomena in flow conditions.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,6,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Simon","given":"Nathaniel"},{"family":"Piqué","given":"Alexander"},{"family":"Snyder","given":"David"},{"family":"Ikuma","given":"Kyle"},{"family":"Majumdar","given":"Anirudha"},{"family":"Hultmark","given":"Marcus"}],"citation-key":"simonFastresponseHotwireFlow2022","container-title":"Measurement Science and Technology","container-title-short":"Meas.

Vacuum annealing produced negligible reaction between the oxide substrate and film, the Au-Ti, however, reacted to form intermetallic compounds with little net elemental redistribution in the film. Heat treating in oxygen resulted in segregation of titanium to the surface where it formed both rutile and anatase structures. In addition, the high interfacial energy between the gold and the oxide phases led to the formation of large (5 micron diameter) gold particles on the film surface or voids at the titania-gold interface. Annealing in Ammomia produced an oxynitride surface in addition to the Ti-Au separation, Au particulate formation, and/or interfacial voiding already observed. The extent of surface degradation observed during these reactive ambient anneals varied with Ti concentration and temperature. The film did not react with SiO2 under any circumstances, however, at temperatures above 650°C in reactive ambients the titanium accumulated at the Al2,O3 interface.

Devices were fabricated with a 50 μm diameter wire suspended across a 500 μm wide cavity in green-body state HTCC, electrically connected to screen printed alumina conductors. The substrate shrinkage during sintering to a cavity width of 400 μm causes the wire element to elevate from the cavity´s bottom surface. Resulting devices were compared with reference devices, containing screen-printed sensor elements, as Pirani gauges operated at 100 °C in constant-resistance mode, and in dynamic mode with a feeding current of 1 A in a pressure range from 10−4 Torr to atmospheric pressure. Also, devices with wire lengths between 500 and 3500 μm were operated and studied in constant-resistance and dynamic mode. Lastly, a device is demonstrated in operation at a mean temperature of 830 °C. The results include wire elements with a consistent elevation from their substrate surfaces, with irregularities along the wires. The wire devices exhibit a faster pressure response in dynamic mode than the reference devices do but operate similarly in constant-resistance mode. Increasing the wire element length shows an increasing dynamic pressure range but a decreasing maximum sensitivity.

The Pirani vacuum gauge is a thermal-based pressure sensor consisting of heater and heat-sink units.

The proposed design has the following merits: (1) The holes on heater increase the thermal resistance and then improve the efficiency of heat transfer; (2) The heat-sink mesas are added to compensate the lost active area between heater and heat sink; (3) Easily integrate with other packaged CMOS-MEMS devices for pressure monitoring [1].

The sensor has two major components: probe and energy supply. Various types of wires and different capacities were studied to design a sensitive probe.

First, the concept of the memory will be presented as well as the switching procedure in the quasi-static case. The Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG) equation will be solved in the case of a macro-spin model in order to assess the dynamic switching behavior of the magnetization. Then, the Eshelby formalism coupled with the Langevin approach will be used to study the influence of temperature on the stability and robustness of the memory. Models predict subnanosecond magnetization switching with a sufficient thermal stability, with an energy cost as low as 0.2 fJ/bit in the case of submicron devices.

  {"id":"vankuijkMultiparameterDetectionFluid1995","abstract":"A micromechanically fabricated thermal flow sensor is presented. The sensor incorporates multiple, 100 μm spaced, resistive sensing elements on a glass substrate in a silicon flow channel. This sensor works on the principle of a travelling heat pulse through the fluid. The response to this heat pulse at different positions upstream and downstream from a heater is used to determine not only flow velocities but also fluid properties. Theoretical analysis of the sensor response shows that the sensor is more able to discriminate between flow velocities and fluid properties when certain combinations of sensing element signals are used. It is shown that the sensor can also measure mass flow as long as the 'time of flight' of a heat pulse can be measured at equal distances from the heater upstream and downstream. Combination of the 'time of flight' at two different positions downstream can be used to determine the diffusivity of the fluid. The sensor can be made sensitive to flow velocity by taking the heat pulse response at two different locations downstream at an instant in time when the signal amplitudes are equal. The 'time of flight' measured at one position downstream is only accurate when the velocities are high enough since the diffusive effect can be neglected. The ability of an artificial neural network to learn to discriminate between the flow velocity and fluid properties is analyzed.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,2,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Kuijk","given":"J.","non-dropping-particle":"van"},{"family":"Lammerink","given":"T.

Then, the thermal conductivity and thermal diffusivity of TiO2/distilled water nanofluids at different temperatures and volume fractions and the thermal conductivity of SiO2 nanofluids with different carrier fluids (water, ethanol, and EG) are determined. The results show that the working temperature and the carrier fluid play important roles in the enhancement of thermal transport in nanofluids. These results agree with the predictions for the temperature dependence effect by the Brownian motion model and the micro-convection model. For SiO2 nanofluids, the thermal-conductance enhancement becomes strong with a decrease in the heat capacity of the carrier fluids.

On the one hand, a greater temperature coefficient was obtained without increasing power consumption by taking advantage of series diodes; on the other hand, the sensor structure and geometries were redesigned to enlarge temperature variation. After that, the sensor was fabricated and tested. Test results indicated that the dynamic vacuum pressure range of the sensor was from 10-1 to 10⁴ Pa when the forward bias current was as low as 10 μA with a power consumption of 50 μW.

In a second step, the sensors are calibrated in a large subsonic wind tunnel up to a velocity of 100m/s, which corresponds to a range of τw=±14Pa of wall shear-stress that is closer to realistic values in low-speed aerodynamic flows. A method to measure the frequency response of the calorimetric sensors is also proposed. At an average wall shear-stress of τw¯=1Pa, the sensors exhibit a cut-off frequency of approximately 1kHz. Finally, the strong influence of the inter-beam distance on the static and dynamic characteristics of calorimetric sensors is demonstrated.11An early version of this article was first presented at the 52nd 3AF International Conference on Applied Aerodynamics (Lyon, France) on March 29, 2017.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,6,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Weiss","given":"Julien"},{"family":"Jondeau","given":"Emmanuel"},{"family":"Giani","given":"Alain"},{"family":"Charlot","given":"Benoît"},{"family":"Combette","given":"Philippe"}],"citation-key":"weissStaticDynamicCalibration2017","container-title":"Sensors and Actuators A: Physical","container-title-short":"Sensors and Actuators A: Physical","DOI":"10/gch36d","ISSN":"0924-4247","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,10,1]]},"language":"en","page":"211-216","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Static and dynamic calibration of a MEMS calorimetric shear-stress sensor","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0924424717310191","volume":"265"},

  {"id":"yamamotoAnalysisConvectiveHeat2022","abstract":"When modeling the thermal performance of a building, it is very important to consider the heat transport from the wall of the building to the interior environment. In energy simulations (ES), the convective heat transfer coefficient ( h c ) determines this heat transfer. Therefore, h c is a significant factor in the calculation of room temperature. In the field of architecture, h c utilizes the temperature of the turbulent zone as a reference temperature. However, the definition of this reference temperature is ambiguous. The preferred definition of the reference temperature is y ⁺ , and this is based on Prandtl's wall law. The reference temperature has a large impact on the calculation of h c , but it is difficult to evaluate the convective component. Nevertheless, it is possible to extract the velocity component near the wall using a shear stress-based velocity scale, but previous studies have not clarified how the latter and the reference temperature contribute to h c . Until now, the method used to calculate h c has been based on a combination of experimental and analytical methods, such as the use of inflow air temperature as the reference temperature in wind tunnel experiments. In this study, we analyze the method used for calculating heat flow and introduce a new method for calculating h c . In an actual environment, the turbulent flow field is expected to be strongly affected by the nearby flow velocity and reference temperature. To model such a turbulent flow field, we conducted a basic study in which a unidirectional flow was blown across a floor mat. Specifically, the influences of the shear stress-based velocity scale and the reference temperature were investigated by varying the inflow velocity temperature from 10 °C to 40 °C. The analysis first showed that h c and the shear stress-based velocity scale were highly correlated (R ² = 0.8073). However, an analysis of the outliers revealed a significant contribution from the reference temperature.\nIn conclusion, the value of h c cannot be determined solely by the shear stress-based velocity scale, even in cases involving forced convection. Our findings provide very important information for ES settings in the field of architecture and will significantly contribute to the field of thermal environment simulation.","author":[{"family":"Yamamoto","given":"Tatsuhiro"}],"citation-key":"yamamotoAnalysisConvectiveHeat2022","container-title":"E3S Web of Conferences","container-title-short":"E3S Web of Conferences","DOI":"10/gsdf49","issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,8,31]]},"page":"04025","source":"ResearchGate","title":"Analysis of convective heat transfer coefficient using shear stress-based velocity scale","type":"article-journal","volume":"356"},

However, current microelectromechanical system (MEMS) Si-based accelerometer cannot adapt to higher temperatures than 500 °C. Because of its excellent properties in high temperature environments, silicon carbide (SiC) shows promising potential in development of high temperature MEMS sensors, and it is a good alternative to Si for developing accelerometers. Due to the difficulty of bulk-SiC fabrication process and the complex structure of MEMS accelerometers, there are few studies on bulk SiC accelerometers and few test data of the performance. In this study, in order to solve the problem of fabrication, a MEMS accelerometer based on bulk SiC processing technology is designed, and fabricated. The sensor is fabricated using a 4H-SiC wafer and adopts the classic elastic beam-proof mass structure. The top surface of the wafer is a doped N-type SiC epitaxial layer that is used as piezoresistive material to develop sensitive resistance. Ultra-thin (20 μm) elastic beams obtained using dry etching form the sensitive mechanical structure to realize a high-sensitivity output in low/medium-g-value environments. The static flip and dynamic vibration experiments show that the final sensor can test low/medium-g-value acceleration signals precisely. Finally, the dynamic sensitivity obtained is 0.21 mV/g under 5 V input voltage and the linearity is 99.8%.
